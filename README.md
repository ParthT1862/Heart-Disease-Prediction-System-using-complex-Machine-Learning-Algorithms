# INTRODUCTION
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection of this condition is critical for preventing serious health complications. With the increasing availability of medical data and the advancement of ML algorithms, heart disease prediction has become a popular application of AI in healthcare. Heart disease prediction aims to identify individuals who are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease using various clinical and demographic features, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors. By leveraging the power of ML, doctors can accurately predict the likelihood of developing heart disease and take preventive measures to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular complications. In this way, heart disease prediction models have the potential to save countless lives and improve the overall quality of healthcare.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM
Heart disease is a prevalent health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a leading cause of death, and early detection and prevention can significantly improve patient outcomes. Therefore, a heart disease prediction system is essential to identify individuals who are at risk of developing heart disease. Our proposed heart disease prediction system is an advanced machine learning-based system designed to accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The system is built on a large dataset of clinical and demographic information of patients who have previously been diagnosed with heart disease.

# MACHINE LEARNING MODELS USED
# 1. MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON
Neural networks are a type of ML algorithm that are capable of learning complex relationships between input features and output labels. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that has been used in various fields including medical diagnosis. Itâ€™s also used in the diagnosis of heart disease. The MLP model consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that learn to represent the data and make predictions based on this representation. In the case of heart disease diagnosis, MLP can learn patterns in the data that are indicative of heart disease, such as high bp, abnormal heart rhythms, or high chol. levels. MLP shows promising results in diagnosing heart disease and can potentially be used as a tool to assist doctors in making accurate and timely diagnosis.
